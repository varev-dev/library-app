# Library Web Application

## Simple borrow - return book CRUD written using Spring (Java) and Vue (JavaScript) storing data in relational SQL database (MySQL).

This project is a response to problems related to the currently operating 
system which contains many dysfunctions like:

* **No access** to account operations history.
* **Outdated** employee interface.
* **Slow**, delayed operations.
* **Long queues** for service.

By creating own application using modern techniques we applied functionalities:

* **Friendly interface** for employees and users.
* Online appointment **booking**.
* Fast work in **real time**.
* Full **account** history.
